# AngularTest

Create a page depicting a form designer, where a user can create a custom field from the default field types available and dynamically display a form

# Getting Started

Change directory into angular-test and write the command ng-serve --open
The project will run on the localhost:4200

# Prerequisites

Install Node package 

# Installing

The npm start command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into dist/, watches for changes to the source files, and runs lite-server on port 4200.
Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

# npm scripts

These are the most useful commands defined in package.json:

 - npm start
 - runs the TypeScript compiler, asset copier, and a server at the same time, all three in "watch mode".
npm run build - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier once.
npm run build:watch - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier in "watch mode"; when changes occur to source files, they will be recompiled or copied into dist/.
npm run lint - runs tslint on the project files.
npm run serve - runs lite-server.
These are the test-related scripts:

npm test - builds the application and runs Intern tests (both unit and functional) one time.
npm run ci - cleans, lints, and builds the application and runs Intern tests (both unit and functional) one time.
